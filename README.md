<h1>Box Shifter I</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a small passion project game I made before the start of my final high school year in the summer time. This is a game that replicates the ideas from the old sokobun game. This has a spin on it adding a few more features to the game. 

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This project taught me so much about how basic 2D games function. I covered game loops, collision and movement. As well as this was my first time using classes and how they work. This also taught me the basics of reading from a external file via the saving mechanic.
