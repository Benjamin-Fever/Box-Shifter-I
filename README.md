# Box-Shifter-I
This is a small game I made before the start of my final high school year in the summer. This is a game that replicates the ideas from the old sokobun game. This has a spin on it adding a few more features to the game.
The code includes a few levels and when you enter the "debug-mode" in game you can create levels that are printed in the console as nested list that represents the maps. This taught me the very basics of using classes and using a framework like pygame.
